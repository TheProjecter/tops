== Tagged Releases ==

You can get a list of all the available tagged releases with:
{{{
% svn list --verbose http://tops.googlecode.com/svn/tags
}}}
To check out a read-only copy of a tagged version use, for example (checks out V0.1):
{{{
% svn checkout http://tops.googlecode.com/svn/tags/V0.1 tops
}}}
This will create and fill a tops/ subdirectory of your current working directory.

In the future, tagged releases may also be available as downloadable archives (tar.gz or zip) from the [http://code.google.com/p/tops/downloads/list project's download page]. Is there a need for this?

== Development Snapshot ==

To install the most recent development snapshot, use:
{{{
% svn checkout http://tops.googlecode.com/svn/trunk tops
}}}
This will create and fill a tops/ subdirectory of your current working directory. You can update your snapshot at any time (assuming you have not changed it) using, from the same working directory:
{{{
% svn update tops
}}}
