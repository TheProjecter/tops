Python 2.5 is required, although the only thing that breaks 2.4 is a few conditional expressions (x = a if b else c), so this could be relaxed without too much trouble if necessary. Using 2.5.2.

- twisted : Provides our low-level networking framework. Using 8.1.0.
- google.protobuf : Provides our network serialization framework. Using 2.0.0 and 2.0.1.
- pycrypto: Provides encryption of private data. Using 2.0.1.
