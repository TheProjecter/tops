= Configuration Files =

Runtime configuration is stored in files with the extension ".ini" in the standard and simple [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file INI file format].

Files are searched in the following order:
  # tops.core: config.ini
  # tops._project_: config.ini
  # _file specified on the [Running start command line] with the --config option_
_project_ is, for example, sdss3. There is no error if a file is missing.

An INI file is organized into named sections, and specifies parameters for each section. If a section parameter appears in more than one file, the last value found (according to the search order above) will be used.

The order of sections within an INI file is not important and neither is the order of parameters within a section (unless a parameter is repeated within the same file and section which should not be the case).

= Configuration Parameters =

A named section with a 'service' parameter identifies a process that can be started to provide a TOPS runtime service. The value of the service parameter is the python module path of the service main entry point. The [Running TOPS start program] scans through the configuration files to determine the available services and will start them in increasing order of their launch_order parameter. Set the 'enable' parameter to something other than 'True' to prevent a service being started.
