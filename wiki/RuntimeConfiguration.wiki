= Configuration Files =

Runtime configuration is stored in files with the extension ".ini" in the standard and simple [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file INI file format].

Files are searched in the following order:
  # tops.core: config.ini
  # tops._project_: config.ini
  # working directory: tops-config.ini
_project_ is, for example, sdss3. There is no error if a file is missing.
