= Instructions for Running TOPS =

TOPS consists of a number of processes that provide core and project-specific services. Processes can be distributed across multiple hosts but, for the best performance and easiest management, should all be run on a single multi-core host. The only exceptions are any services that need direct access to resources on a remote host, such as a particular serial port.

The top-level start program launches all the services specified in the [RuntimeConfiguration run-time configuration] files on a single host.
