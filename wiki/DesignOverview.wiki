= Overview of the Operations Software Design =

The operations software is designed as three horizontal layers that interface the system's users to its hardware devices:
  * Sessions: the interface between users and applications.
  * Applications: the GUI and scripting environment that users interact with.
  * [Proxies]: the interface between applications and hardware devices.
These layers are vertically integrated with the following operations infrastructure:
  * [Logging]: the destination for all text-based data.
  * [Archiving]: the destination for all numeric data.
  * [Configuration]: management of the run-time configuration for operations services.
  * [ProcessControl]: monitoring and control of the co-operating processes that provide operations services.
  * [FileHandling File Handling]: assembling and transporting the potentially large files produced during operations.
The following block diagram illustrates the relationships between these components:
