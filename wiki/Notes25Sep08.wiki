= Notes for the 25 Sep 2008 SDSS-3 Infrastructure Meeting =

After a productive week of commissioning at APO, a first release of the new operations software is now available. The software now also has a name, TOPS, for Telescope OPerations Software.

The software is being developed as an [License open source project] hosted at [http://tops.googlecode.com], which includes a public code repository, a documentation wiki (which you are reading now), and issue tracker.
